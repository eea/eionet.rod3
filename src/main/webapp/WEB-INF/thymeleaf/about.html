ROD is the EEA's reporting obligations database. It contains records
describing environmental reporting obligations that countries have towards
international organisations. ROD is part of Reportnet. Reportnet is
group of web applications and processes developed by the EEA to support
international environmental reporting.

<h2>What are reporting obligations?</h2>
<p>
Reporting obligations are requirement to provide information agreed
between countries and international bodies, such as the EEA or
international conventions. Reporting obligations provide the basis for
most environmental information flows.
</p>
<p>
A reporting obligation is taken to mean any requirement to provide
specified information to a secretariat, coordinating body or governing
body of a legal instrument, or their representatives, whether or not there
is a prescribed format or fixed frequency, or whether or not the word
'report' is used. Reporting obligations can be 'compulsory', 'expected'
or 'voluntary' depending on whether information must be submitted in
order to be in compliance with the legal instrument or is just submitted
by countries at their own volition.
