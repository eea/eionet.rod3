                ROD is the EEA's reporting obligations database. It contains records
                describing environmental reporting obligations that countries have towards
                international organisations. ROD is part of Reportnet. Reportnet is
                group of web applications and processes developed by the EEA to support
                international environmental reporting.

            <h2>What are reporting obligations?</h2>
            <p>
                Reporting obligations are requirement to provide information agreed
                between countries and international bodies, such as the EEA or
                international conventions. Reporting obligations provide the basis for
                most environmental information flows.
            </p>
            <p>
                A reporting obligation is taken to mean any requirement to provide
                specified information to a secretariat, coordinating body or governing
                body of a legal instrument, or their representatives, whether or not there
                is a prescribed format or fixed frequency, or whether or not the word
                'report' is used. Reporting obligations can be 'compulsory', 'expected'
                or 'voluntary' depending on whether information must be submitted in
                order to be in compliance with the legal instrument or is just submitted
                by countries at their own volition.
            </p>
